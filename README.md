# PrefabKit

The prefab app framework for content-based iOS apps.

## What is PrefabKit?

PrefabKit is a Swift framework that makes it easy to create content-based iOS apps. It contains a set of modules that cover essential functionalities required in many apps, enabling developers to bypass the repetitive groundwork that often consumes substantial time and resources at the beginning of new projects.

The best way to get started with PrefabKit is by using [Prefabrik](https://www.prefabrik.app), an iOS app that allows you to create, configure, and test your PrefabKit-based apps instantly.

## Project Status: Early Stage Development

PrefabKit is in its early stages of development. As with any early-stage project, users may encounter bugs or stability issues in the near term (if this happens to you, please file an issue 🙏).

Some planned features are still under active development, and the framework is likely to evolve significantly in the coming months based on early tester feedback. Some changes may not be backwards-compatible, requiring adjustments in your projects. Thank you for your patience and understanding during this early stage.

## Recommended Use

PrefabKit apps are best suited for prototyping and early testing. At this stage, it's not recommended to deploy PrefabKit apps directly to production for widespread distribution without any further testing or customization.
